			<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
			<p>Sherlock Holmes is a 2009 mystery period action film based on the character of the same name created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
			In 1890, private detective Sherlock Holmes and his partner Dr. John Watson prevent the ritual murder of a woman by Lord Henry Blackwood, who has killed five other young women similarly.
			Inspector Lestrade and the police arrest Blackwood. Three months later, Watson is engaged to Mary Morstan and moving out of 221B Baker Street;
			while he enjoys their adventures together, Watson looks forward to not having to deal with Holmes' eccentricities. 
			Meanwhile, Blackwood has been sentenced to death and requests to see Holmes, whom he warns of three more unstoppable deaths that will cause great changes to the world.
			Blackwood is subsequently hanged.

			  <div class="collapse">
				<p>Holmes is visited by Irene Adler, a former adversary who asks him to find a missing man named Luke Reordan.
				After her departure, Holmes follows her as she meets with her secret employer, and only learns that the man is a professor and that he intimidates Adler.
				Meanwhile, sightings of a living Blackwood and the discovery of his destroyed tomb lead to belief that Blackwood has risen from the grave.
				Reordan is found dead inside Blackwood's coffin. Following a series of clues from the body, Holmes and Watson find Reordan's home and discover experiments attempting to merge science with magic.
				After they survive a battle with Blackwood's men who attempt to destroy the lab, Holmes is taken to the Temple of the Four Orders, a secret magical fraternity with considerable political influence.
				The leaders – Lord Chief Justice Sir Thomas Rotheram, U.S. Ambassador Standish, and Home Secretary Lord Coward– ask Holmes to stop Blackwood, a former member of the society and Sir Thomas's secret illegitimate son.
				</p>
				<p>That night, Sir Thomas drowns in his bath as Blackwood watches, and the next night Lord Coward calls a meeting of the Order.
				He nominates Blackwood to take command in place of Sir Thomas and Blackwood reveals himself to the group.
				Standish attempts to shoot Blackwood but is set on fire when he pulls the trigger of his gun, and runs out a window to his death. Lord Coward issues an arrest warrant for Holmes, causing him to go into hiding.
				Holmes studies the rituals of the Order and recognizes their symbols in Blackwood's murders that were staged at specific locations; from this he deduces the targets of the final murder are the members of Parliament.
				With the aid of Lestrade, Holmes fakes arrest and is taken to see Coward, where he uses evidence on Coward's clothes to deduce Blackwood has conducted a ceremony in the sewers beneath the Palace of Westminster.

			<h3>THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLE</h3>
			<p class="blg">I've never been happier to see anyone than I was to see Henry Knight. Sherlock
			had been bored. And trust me, you don't want to be around him when he's 
			bored. He's hyperactive, rude, arrogant and a real pain in the behind.
			</p>
			<p class="blg">Yeah I know, same old Sherlock.
			</p>
			<p class="blg">Henry, a normal-looking bloke in his late 20s, was clearly very anxious when he
			arrived at Baker Street. He told us about how, twenty years before, his dad had
			died. He told us how his Dad had been ripped apart by the Devil.
			</p>
			<p class="blg">They'd been out for a walk on Dartmoor when they'd been attacked. Some kind
			of monster - big, black with red glowing eyes - had killed his father in front of
			him.</p>
			<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Read More</button>
			  <div class="collapse">
					<p>Apparently it had taken place near the Government's Baskerville research
					facility. Sherlock worked out that something must have happened the previous
					night to make Henry suddenly ask for help that morning. Henry said that his
					therapist, Doctor Louise Mortimer, had suggested he revisit the location of the
					attack in order to put old ghosts to rest. Henry had done this and, to his horror,
					had discovered some footprints. Footprints that appeared to have been made by,
					what he called, a 'gigantic hound'. There'd been rumours that experiments on
					animals had been taking place at the Baskerville facility since WWII. And so,
					Sherlock took the case and off we went into deepest, darkest Devon.
					</p>
					<p class="blg">Our first port of call was the local pub. There we found a guy who ran walks on
					the moors etc. He claimed to know a man from the MOD who'd once said he'd
					seen giant animals at a government research facility - rats as big as dogs and
					dogs as big as horses. It wasn't exactly irrefutable evidence but all signs did
					seem to be pointing at the Baskerville facility. Sherlock had some ID he'd
					appropriated so we were able to bluff our way in. Again, because of the Official
					Secrets Act, I can't talk too much about what I saw in there but, as well as
					seeing some of what they go up to, we met Doctor Jacqui Stapleton and the
					annoyingly-cheerful Doctor Bob Frankland. Stapleton, Sherlock realised, was the
					mother of a little girl who'd written to him recently .
					</p>
					<p class="blg">We then went to see Henry at his home where he told us that something else had
					come back to him about the night his father died - two words: Liberty and In.
					Sherlock then announced his next move - we'd take Henry up to the moors that
					night and see if anything else attacked him. I'm not sure who was more worried about this, me or Henry.
					</p>
					<p class="blg">Turns out we were both right to be worried. That night, I heard the hound. Well, I
					heard something. The place was so bleak and desolate but I was sure it wasn't
					my mind playing tricks on me. But it got worse - Sherlock and Henry saw it.
					Sherlock denied it at first, but back at the pub he finally admitted to me that he'd
					seen it. I've never seen him so shaken, so scared. He was actually terrified. We
					parted company and I went to interview Louise Mortimer, Henry's therapist. She
					was starting to open up to me when Frankland arrived, interrupting us. Things
					weren't going well.
					</p>
					<p class="blg">The next morning, I met up with Sherlock and we discussed the previous
					evening. He admitted that as well as fear, the worst thing he'd felt was doubt.
					He'd never doubted himself before and he simply couldn't understand how he'd
					seen what he'd seen. Luckily, I'd already spotted a clue. A receipt for meat at the
					vegetarian hotel and restaurant we were staying at. When confronted, the
					owners admitted that they'd bought a dog to help cash in on the rising tourist
					trade but that they'd had it put down some time before. It certainly hadn't been
					what Sherlock had seen the previous night.
					</p>
					<p class="blg">And therefore it certainly wasn't what I was about to see.
					</p>
					<p class="blg">We returned to the base to talk to Doctor Stapleton. Before meeting up with her,
					though, Sherlock sent me off to look for any sign of this 'monster' , so i started in
					the main lab. And I was trapped when it came for me it. I could hear it... And
					then I saw it... I've been through some terrifying experiences in my life but that
					was one of the worst. Something that just seemed so unbelievable and so unstoppable... Those eyes...
					</p>
					<p class="blg">And then Sherlock rescued me and revealed that I'd been drugged. I saw the
					hound because that's what I'd expected to see. Obviously, as a doctor, I've seen
					the effects of a number of different drugs but this... I hadn't just seen the hound.
					I'd heard it. I'd felt it getting closer. I'd felt the fear inside me...
					</p>
					<p class="blg">We met up with Stapleton again and, in her lab, Sherlock examined some sugar
					from Henry's house. He'd noticed that both and he and Henry took sugar in their
					coffee which would explain why they'd seen the hound the previous night and I
					hadn't. It also explained why Sherlock had made me coffee that morning and put
					sugar in it. He'd used me as an experiment. One day, I will kill him.
					</p>
					<p class="blg">There was one thing that had bothered Sherlock from the start and that was
					Henry's use of the word 'hound'. It was an odd word, old-fashioned. He
					wondered whether it was another piece of his memory trying to break through
					and whether it was actually an acronym he'd seen. Using the facility's computers,
					we managed to discover the existence of an old scientific project, indeed known
					as H.O.U.N.D. The project had been to design and develop a weapon that could
					create fear in the enemy. It had been closed down when they'd realised that
					prolonged exposure had caused people to lose their sanity. And where had the
					project been developed? Liberty, Indiana. Liberty. In. Henry had been
					remembering things!
					</p>
					<p class="blg">Then his therapist, Louise, called. Henry had lost it. He'd turned a gun on her and
					fled. She was all right but she was scared about what he might do to himself. We
					returned to the moors, to the place where Henry's dad had been killed and there
					he was. He was close to killing himself. His mind just couldn't cope with all the
					conflicting information - what he remembered, what he thought he remembered,
					everything. Sherlock knew that he'd started to remember that it had actually
					been a man who had killed his father and not a monster. Witnessing this as a kid,
					he'd tried to rationalise it into something different. He'd created the hound out of
					the various images he'd seen - the crazed man and the acronym which his
					father's murderer had been wearing on a sweatshirt. H.O.U.N.D.
					</p>
					<p class="blg">And then we all saw the hound again. It was coming for us. I knew, I rationalised
					that it wasn't real, that I was just seeing things but it was there... Coming for
					us...
					</p>
					<p class="blg">And so was the man behind it all. Doctor Frankland. He was wearing a gasmask
					which told Sherlock what he needed to know - the poison, the weapon that
					H.O.U.N.D. had created hadn't been in the sugar. It was in the fog! We were in a
					chemical minefield. As the hound prepared to attack, we shot it and we saw that
					it was just a dog. And then Sherlock did one of the most human things I think
					I've ever seen him do - he made Henry look at the dog's body. He didn't need to,
					he'd solved the case but it was as if he knew that the truly important thing was
					showing Henry what was real and what wasn't. Maybe the fear and doubt he'd
					felt, and maybe his experiences with Irene Adler, had humanised him?
					</p>
					<p class="blg">Of course, he immediately started raving on in front of Henry about what a
					fantastic case it had been and I realised he hadn't changed that much.
					</p>
					<p class="blg">And later, I realised something else. Sherlock had thought that the poison was in
					the sugar at first. He'd been convinced . Sherlock had made a mistake.
					</p>
					<p>He is only human, after all.
